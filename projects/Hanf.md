<h1 style="color:green;">What is the William P. Hanf Competition?</h1>

A competetion offered to me at the beggining of my Calculus 1 class that I took with Professor Guerzhoy, in honor of a fondly remembered UH professor: William P. Hanf.

  <h1 style="color:green;">The Problem:</h1>
I was given a list of 13 problems to choose from, and I chose this one as it sounded more like a puzzle than a standard math problem. The primary application of the problem has everything to do with the Pigeonhole-Principle: an interesting mathmatical principle which has gone to prove things such as determining that there's at least 2 people in London that have the exact same number of hairs on their head, to simpler things such as having a room filled with 367 random people guarentees that at least 2 attendees share the same birthday. Completing one of the problems was an extra credit opporotunity which I never allow myself to let go. Thus began my journey into solving it.
